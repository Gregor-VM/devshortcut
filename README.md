### How can I added an example?

To add en example go to the file _src/utils/examples.ts_ and add your example on the list of examples, make sure that all tags exists or create them if neccesary, also make sure that the example title is unique.

Adittionally, if you want to add a local example, make sure to provide the _folder_ property with the name of the folder that contains your example code in the examples folder and be sure that the tabs names correspond to each tab on you code example.
